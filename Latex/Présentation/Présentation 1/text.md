Morning Teachers, 
Today, we will present you our project, which is a project related neural networks and more specifically, spiking neural networks. In our case, we decided to focus on the implementation of a spiking neural network for audio classification purposes.
We want to be able to classify audio signals into different categories, such as speech, music, noise, dog bark, etc.
We will start by giving you a brief overview of what spiking neural networks are, how they are different from traditional neural networks and how they basically work.
Then, we will present you the dataset we currently use for our project, how we are using it and what did we do to make it usable for our project.
